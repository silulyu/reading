Read-heavy applications are usually easier to scale.
Being read-heavy means there are plenty more requests that only need to fetch (and output) data, compared to those that store data.
Read-heavy applications are mostly about being able to service requests.
What you need here is enough machines to handle the load: 
enough application servers to do the computing and/or enough database slaves to read from (more on both later.)

Write-heavy applications will need even more careful planning. 
Not only will they likely have the read-problems as well, you’ll also need to be able to store the data somewhere.
If there’s lots of it & continuously growing, it might outgrow your machine.
