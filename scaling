Vertical scaling means that you increase your overall capacity by increasing the the capacity of its machines.

Horizontal scaling means adding more machines to your setup.
In computer hardware, scaling horizontally (a cluster of lower tier machines) is usually cheaper compared to scaling vertically (one supercomputer). It also provides failover: if one machine dies, the others can take over. However, horizontal scaling is often harder from a software point of view, because data is now distributed over multiple machines.
